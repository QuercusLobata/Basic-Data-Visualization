# Basic-Data-Visualization
In August 2020 I moved to New York and immediately holed up in my room for a two-week COVID quarantine. To keep myself entertained, I started learning Python. I decided to use Pandas and Seaborn to graph social media data for a marketing strategy client instead of using Excel.

What I did:
- Installed and updated packages using Anaconda
- Set up my Jupyter notebook with Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, and Textstat
- Formatted my data to analyze when social media posts were published
- Formatted my data to analyze post reading level in English and Spanish
- Explored different graph types in Seaborn
